# Godot 4 Component Toolbox

![Godot Engine](https://img.shields.io/badge/GODOT-%23FFFFFF.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=godot-engine)

A collection of [simple components](doc/index.md) that are designed to be easy to use, ready to be dropped into a Godot 4 project with minimal configuration, and "smart" (or at least sensible) defaults.

These components may be useful for rapid prototyping, quickly testing ideas without requiring major time investment, and for learning.

While efforts has been made to make components robust and performant enough for development use, they are not necessarily optimised for production environments. *Caveat consumptor*.
