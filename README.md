# Building-Block (BB) Components for Godot 4

Released under the [MIT license](LICENSE).

![Godot Engine](https://img.shields.io/badge/GODOT-%23FFFFFF.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=godot-engine)

A collection of [simple building-block components](doc/README.md) that are designed to be easy to use and be dropped into any Godot 4 project, ready to use with no (or minimal) configuration, and "smart" (or at least sensible) defaults.

These components may be useful for rapid prototyping, quickly testing ideas without requiring major time investment, and for learning (feel free to check out the [lovingly-commented source code](addons/bc-components/)).

While efforts has been made to make the components robust and performant enough for development use, they are not necessarily optimised for production environments. *Caveat consumptor*.  If in doubt, feel free to disassemble and reassemble the components to your own purposes.
