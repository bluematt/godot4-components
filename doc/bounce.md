Class: `BBBounce`

Add a bouncing effect to a `Node2D`.

Attach the `BounceComponent` to a `Node2D` to enable a simple bouncing mechanic.

Internally it uses a `Tween` to control the bounce mechanic, moving the `node` between its original position and the position described by the `displacement` from the original position.

Note: In `Loop.PING_PONG` mode, the `duration` refers to movement in one direction only.  The return movement will also take `duration` seconds.

## API

###Â Enumerations

- `Loop { FROM_START, PING_PONG, OFF }` - Looping types.

### Signals

- `started()` - Emitted when the bounce has started.
- `stopped()` - Emitted when the bounce has stopped.

### Properties

- `displacement: Vector2 = Vector2.ZERO` - How far to move the node.
- `duration: float = 1.0` - How long the bounce should take (in seconds).
- `easing: Tween.EaseType = Tween.EASE_IN` - The easing type.
- `enabled: bool = true` - Whether the bounce effect is enabled.
- `loop: Loop { FROM_START, PING_PONG, OFF } = Loop.FROM_START` - How to loop the bounce.
- `node: Node2D` - The node to bounce.
- `repeats: int = 0` - How many times to repeat.  0 means repeat infinitely.
- `transition: Tween.TransitionType = Tween.TRANS_SINE` - The transition type.

### Methods

- `play()`  - Play the bounce animation.
- `stop()`  - Stop the bounce animation.
